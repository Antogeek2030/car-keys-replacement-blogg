Your car key can get lost when you least expect it. 

You may want to drive somewhere only to find that you don’t have your key with you. 

You’ll search for it in all pockets, bags, and places you recently visited, then start panicking once you realize that your keys are lost. 

Now, you’ll have to call a locksmith, arrange a tow, or miss an important appointment. 

This is why it’s important to have a spare car key.

According to automotive experts, up to 60% of people experience delays due to lost car keys. 

A spare key can be the difference between a minor and a disruption in your schedule. 

In this article, we'll explore reasons to invest in a spare car key as a Kenyan driver. 

## 1.Preventing Car Lockouts

One of the main reasons to have a spare car key is to avoid car lockouts. 

It can occur when you accidentally leave your key inside the car, drop it somewhere, or lose it during a busy day. 

Without a spare, you will have to call a roadside assistance service or a locksmith to help you. This process can take hours and leave you stranded in unsafe locations.

But if you have a spare key at home or with a friend, you can get the key and enter your car in minutes. You won’t have to break your windows or force entry. 

Overall, duplicate keys have saved many road trippers. Those who keep one in their wallets can keep driving while waiting to get another replacement. 

## 2.Cost Savings

Duplicating your key while you still have the original is cheaper than replacing a lost one. 

For standard keys, a duplicate might cost 3000-8000. But if you lose your only key, you might pay 10,000-20,000 or more for a complete replacement, including locksmith and programming fees.

The cost increases because auto locksmiths must create a new key from scratch, often requiring electronic syncing. But with spare keys, you’ll save up to 50% on overall key-related expenses.

## 3.Convenience for Multiple Drivers

It’s convenient to have a spare car key in households with shared vehicles.

If many people in your family use one car, such as your parents or teens, consider getting a spare key to allow for easier car sharing. 

A spare key is also helpful for company cars or people running car rental businesses. Your employees can use spares without disrupting their programs. 

For instance, if one driver forgets the keys at home, a duplicate in the office ensures the other employees can use the ride. 

Beyond sharing, spares enables users to perform car servicing and repairs, and even lend their rides to friends, all while keeping the primary key. 

## 4.Reduced Stress

The psychological benefits of having a spare car key are priceless. Knowing you have a backup stops you from thinking about what you will do if you lose your car keys. 

Here’s a practical example: 

In Nairobi, it’s easy to miss your flight because of misplacing your car keys. But if you have a spare, you will retrieve the key and drive your car, rather than worrying about the consequences of losing your keys. 

## 5.Backup for Damage

Car keys experience wear and tear, from drops to exposure to harsh weather conditions. 

Also, the batteries in fobs can die, the blades can bend, or the chips can malfunction, rendering them useless. 

Though regular key maintenance helps, damage is inevitable. Always have a spare key. It ensures you can use your car whenever you want while repairing the original. The second key is a must-have, especially if you rely on your vehicle.
